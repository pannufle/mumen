FreeDict - free bilingual dictionaries
=======================================

The FreeDict project aims at providing free (open source) dictionary databases,
to be used both by humans and machines

The official home is at <http://freedict.org>. This page details how to get and
use the dictionaries.

Development
===========

All dictionaries are encoded in
[TEI (version 5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative)
which is a flexible XML format to encode human speech. The FreeDict project
provides dictionaries but also style sheets to convert the TEI databases into
human-readable formats.

In the past there were a variety of output formats, but at the moment only the
[dict format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICT)
is supported.

Installation
============

As mentioned above, please have a look at <http://freedict.org> for
instructions. For Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, the installation is really easy. Just
search in the package manager for packages containing "freedict", i.e. for the
English-German dictionary:

    sudo apt-get install dictd gnome-dictionary dict-freedict-eng-deu
