3. Input a YACAB dump containing a list of crowdsourced annotations and output a MEN dataset


## Evaluation template
| Standard                                | YES |  NO |
| --------------------------------------- | :-: | :-: |
| Does the app build correctly           |     |     |
| Is the test coverage 100%           |     |     |
| Is the codeclimate metric equal to 4    |     |     |
| Does the README include clear instructions on how to run the app          |     |     |
| Do those instructions work          |     |     |
| Is the pipeline of the application documented          |     |     |
| Is it documented in a diagram         | | |
| Does the architecture of the application match the documented pipeline    | | |
| Is the team progress clearly documented in the README (with a list of completed tasks and remaining todos)        | | |
| Is the list of todos comprehensive       | | |
| Is the architecture scalable (can additionnal modules, languages, utils be added without breaking the app)        | | |
| Are architectural choices consistent across the app       | | |
| Is the config fully externalized        | | |
| Is the setup.py fully configured for modularization with PyPy        | | |
| Are all good practices respected        | | |
| Do docstrings fully respect reST standards for export to Sphinx       | | |


## HowTo
### Run MuMEN
To run MuMEN, in the application folder, do:
```
python3 setup.py develop
```
Then **download** the freedict xml files from [FreeDict](https://github.com/freedict/fd-dictionaries) and put it in ```data/freedict``` as explained there!

Then run:
```
mumen config/config.yml
```
to launch the application with the standard config

## Useful stuff


### Dictionaries
[WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/), [FreeDict](http://freedict.org/en/) and [JMDict](http://edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html)

### Arabic Preprocessing

The [Stanford Arabic NLP Toolkit](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/arabic.shtml) offers:

* A dependency parser trained on the Penn Arabic Treebank
* A word segmenter
* A POS tagger

The [Microsoft Arabic NLP Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/arabic-toolkit-service-atks/) offers:

* A diacritizer
* A NER
* A morphological analyzer
* A speller
* A transliterator

In terms of corpora, if Wikipedia is not enough we could use the [Gigaword corpus](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003T12). Apparently it contains
nearly 400 million words.

### Japanese Preprocessing

There are several popular tools in the Japanese NLP community:
* [Mecab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) a POS tagger and morphological
analyzer for Japanese
* [Cabocha](http://taku910.github.io/cabocha/) a dependency-structure analyzer

Both are coded in C++ by [Taku Kudo](http://chasen.org/~taku/index.html.en)
but there are some Python wrappers available on GitHub.

* [Kuromoji](http://www.atilika.org/) also does the same thing as Mecab, but
is coded in Java. It seems well maintained (see their [GitHub](https://github.com/atilika/kuromoji)).

In terms of corpora, a good list is available [here](https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/english/database/type/corpora/) and the
balanced corpus of contemporary written Japanese
([BCCWJ](http://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/corpus_center/bccwj/en/)) contains roughly
100 million words (I have a copy of the corpus) but with extensive
morphological annotation.
